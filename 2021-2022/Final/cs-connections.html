       <h2>CS Connections with Computer System Analysts</h2>

     <!--paragraphs and images <p> and <figure> -->
     <p>A computer systems analyst (CSA) manages a company's computer system, and acts as a consultant for a lot of things. Whether it be upgrades and enhancements, or acts as a cybersecurity specialist, in order to keep the company safe. They also specialize in troubleshooting programs, or modifying a system to improve workflow or to serve different purposes.

     <p>So, what does a CSA have in common with computer science? Well, a CSA is just a subsection of Computer Science. It tends to be a lot less intricate, but you need a broader understanding of all the topics at play, instead of just specifically learning one thing.

     <p>Finally, they need good communication skills. When you ask for a consultant, you don’t want someone who sends a one sentence email about their research, you want someone who could come in and debrief you about anything interesting they found, and answer any questions necessary. This is the big part of being a CSA that really isn’t connected to Computer Science at all.
