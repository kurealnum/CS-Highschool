     <p>A Computer Systems Analyst (CSA) seems like a really fun and interesting job to me. This is partially because of the requirements. A full 4 year intensive computer science degree is not necessary. Sometimes, they look for people with a degree in business or economics, which is really cool.

     <p>Another reason I’d be really interested in this job is because it isn’t entirely computer focused. A lot of times, you’re going to act as a consultant and tell your manager what needs to happen to either lower labor costs, improve profit, ect. I’m not sure I’d be completely interested in an entirely computer based environment, so this is really interesting to me.

     <p>Overall, I think this is a really neat occupation. The pay is good, and it doesn’t take a doctorate degree to get into. I’d be able to study things that I’m interested in, as well as hopefully landing a high paying job later in life.
